    <p><span class="rainbow-text">My Dearest  Mr. Fiance,</span></p>

    <p>Many more happy returns of the day to the one who holds my heart in every dimension...</p>

	<p>	On this special day, my only wish and prayer is that life grants you everything you‚Äôve ever desired.. and everything you deserve.. for the rest of your life, our life together.
	</br> Also I have this special request to pray, with all my heart, that this is the last birthday we ever spend apart from each other..</p>

	<p>I wish I could be beside you now‚Ä¶</br>
	To hold your hand while you cut your cake,</br>
	To kiss you softly and lose my breath in your warmth,</br>
	To help you get ready that you inner child jumps out of excitement,</br>
	To cook your favourite food that your taste buds blossom out of joy,</br>
	To roam your back to listen more your burps and farts after food,</br>
	To wrap you in a hug so tight that your ribs would beg for mercy,</br>
	To tease you so hard that your dimple goes more deeper with unlimited laughs and smiles,</br>
	To bite you a lot all your body that your white skin runs blood red,</br>
	To show you lots and lots and lots of love that you couldn't resist but you have happy tears,</br>
	Touchwood.. touchwood.. touchwood.. so on and many more..</br>
	I wish for so many things in this very moment‚Ä¶</p>

	<p>All I want to whisper now in your ears with intense voice is...</br>
	I miss you chinnuuu...</br>
	I miss you everyday and on this special day I miss you even moreee...</br>
	I miss you in ways words can‚Äôt quite hold...</br>
	I miss the warmth of your skin against mine...</br>
	I miss the way your presence makes everything around me feel calmer, safer...</br>
	I miss hearing your voice in the same room, not just over a call... </br>
	I miss the way your eyes undress me without ever touching...</br>
	I miss the way your voice dips when you whisper things meant only for my ears...</br>
	I miss your scent, your weight, your warmth wrapped around me like a promise...</br>
	Every part of me aches to be near you.. to touch you, talk to you, laugh with you, sleep beside you...</br>
	It‚Äôs a strange emptiness, knowing you‚Äôre mine, yet still having to count the days until I can hold you again...</br>
	This is giving me a heart ache... a severe pain...</br>
	My skin aches to touch you and my lips ache to kiss you...</br>
	Every cell of me aches to be with you...</br>
	But when I realise it is only temporary and we are becoming my permenant soon.. my heart is jumping out of joy and happiness...</p>

	<p>But next year, I won‚Äôt have to wish and the missing feel too..</br>
	Next year and every year after.. I‚Äôll be right there.. I'll right next to you.. </br>
	I‚Äôll wake you up at midnight, lying right next to you, whispering birthday wishes into your skin...</br>
	I'll spend this very special day with you in much more special way..</br>
	I‚Äôll be doing all the above things and so much more‚Ä¶ all the little, intimate things you've taught me, all the closeness we both long for...</br>

	I don‚Äôt know how you celebrated your birthdays before I came into your life, but I promise you this: from now on, we‚Äôll celebrate not just birthdays, but every single day we spend together with lots of fun, love, laughter, giggles, kisses, hugs and with many many more that make you feel the luckiest, blessed and the fullest...</br>
	You‚Äôll find magic is real and is just around you..</br>
	It‚Äôs in the ordinary...</br>
	It‚Äôs in every look, every bite of food we share, every stolen moment and quiet smile...</br>
	It‚Äôs in love‚Äîin our love...</p>

	<p>And only this very special day, I also want to remind you this.. </br>
	<span class="rainbow-text">I love you sweetheart.. I love you soo much.. I love you extremely much..</span></br>
	I love you more than I‚Äôve ever known it was possible to love someone and more than you ever can imagine.. </br>
	It‚Äôs not just in the big.. no definitely not.. </br>
	I love you in all possible loud dramatic ways, in all possible realistic ways, in all possible fantacisizing ways.. in all possible ways in all dimensions..</br>
	I love you in a thousand quiet, invisible moments that are beyond our vision like care, obsession I have for you... </br>
	I love you in the way your name sits softly in my thoughts all day no matter what I am doing... </br>
	I love you in how I smile at the memory of your laugh...</br>
	I love you in how I feel a spark in my chest just thinking of your touch... </br>
	I love you in every language my body knows...</br>
	I love you through every heartbeat...</br>
	I love you through every sigh...</br>
	I love you through every ache of longing...</br>
	I love you in the way the ocean loves the moon: pulled endlessly, faithfully, even from miles away just as we are.. relatively less the distance but emotionally more than the distance between them.. </br>
	I love you in the way the fire feels like: warms and burns, heals and ignites...</br>
	I love you in the way the earth feels like: with deeply rooted and making unshakable, I try to make you find you home, your gravity, a place to rest and rise in me... </br>
	I love you in the way the air feels like: even when unseen fill all your heart, your thoughts, our every space in between us...</br>
	I love you in the way the sky feels like: limitless, ever-changing, stretching across every horizon you walk under, every star you sleep beneath...</br>
	Like all the five elements of nature... adapting them to love you more.. I will be always there for you safegaurding and comforting you...</br>
	It‚Äôs not just that I love you... it‚Äôs that I am in love with loving you... And I always will be...</p>

	<p>I just want to add one more thing here..</br>
	Yes, today is your special day‚Ä¶ but if I‚Äôm honest, it feels even more special to me..</br>
	Because today is the day you were born‚Ä¶ the one made for me.</br>

	<p>This year marks something extraordinary.. for both of us... A milstone for both of our lives..</br>
	It‚Äôs the year we become partners, not just in name, but in soul, in heart, in every laugh, every late-night talk, every decision, every stolen kiss.</br>
	And soon‚Ä¶ in time, we‚Äôll grow from lovers to parents, building the most beautiful life together..</br>
	We‚Äôll make love and take decisions, make each other blush, and take every opportunity to tease, please, comfort, and love one another in every possible way... </br>
	We‚Äôll be each other‚Äôs home, safe place, and greatest adventure...</p>

	<p>I may not fully know the depth of your feelings right now... but I want you to know how deeply excited I am to start this journey with you...</br>
	To make you feel home and find peace in me...</br>
	To begin this life with you...</br>
	To give you everything I have...</br>
	To be your comfort, your fire, your peace...</br>
	To be the place you come home to, and the reason you don‚Äôt want to leave...</br>
	To be your little rakshasi and also be your comforting sonamma...</br>
	To be your little psycho and also be your loving ammadu...</br>
	With all my heart, I‚Äôm ready...</p>
